DO NOT USE THIS SKRIPT!

If you somehow see this, PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS VERSION OF NEON/LAZYCORE!
This is an ancient, pretty much the 3rd release of Neon/LazyCore, therefore being super unoptimized and bad.
You can get the new version of Neon/LazyCore from
https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/neon-a-core-for-event-purposes.114312/

Thank you.
